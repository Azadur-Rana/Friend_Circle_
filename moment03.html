    <h1>Unexpected turn!!!</h1>
    <p>This is the day when we went to Uttara for sending a document abroad through DHL in Uttara. It was fahad's police clearance. <br />
        We took there a lot of group selfies. Then we went to a mens clothing shop named  "Heavy Metal". Heavy Metal sell tshirt and warm cloth of different boy bands of Bangladesh and some foreign bands also.<br />
        We went there basically for buying a denim sweater for Saifullah.But there was only one denim available and unfortunately there was a button missing on sternum side.<br /> 
        Fahad was frankly asking for the hoodie named "arvovirus". He tried it on and he liked that. Although he had same hoodie,he bought that again.And we can see Fahad wearing that hoodie in the picture.<br />
        On that same day Saifullah bought a black coloured sweater made of jeans from Board Bazar.It was totally worth it.</p>
