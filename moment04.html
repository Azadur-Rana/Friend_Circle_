    <h1>I have kept 30 days of fasting!!!</h1>
    <p>This is the eid day, specifically Eid-Ul-Fitr.The day before eid Fardin,Saifullah and I went to Nexman shoe store situated at North Tower in Uttara.<br/>
        Fardin and Saifullah bought shoes for themselves. From there we  went to buy some shirts for ourselves. We bought two shirts each.And on eid day as you can see we are wearing them.<br /> 
        This photo is taken Fardin's home.As we are shorten in friends, those are gone to their relatives to celebrate. And we 3 were left alone.But it was good.Alhamdulillah</p>
